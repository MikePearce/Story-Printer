1,"As a merchant, I want DW to be able to track my transactions in multiple currencies, so that I can sell products in multiple currencies","- If the transaction tracked with a currency that the system doesn't manage/understand then an email should be sent to Technical Services with all information for them to eventually contact the merchant (one email per day with all transactions)
- Exchange rates should be updated as frequently as the XE license allows (ideally hourly)
- We should be able to convert from as many currencies as possible
- It should be easy to add a new currency
- We should be able to reprocess (dev work) the transactions that tracked with a unknown currency once we've added the currency
- We should implement the accounting standards when rounding the numbers",Anthony / Chris,13,Initial Scope,,8,Currencies
2,"As a merchant, I want to have all necessary information on the commissions so that I can approve them with efficiency","- transaction amount and commission should be displayed in the primary currency of the programme (display the converted value when it tracked)
- it should be clear when a transaction didn't track in the primary currency
- It should be possible to view the orginial value of the transaction and the exchange rate used
- all current features to approving commissions should continue to work normally",Anthony / Chris,5,Initial Scope,,8,Currencies
3,"As a merchant, I want to define affiliate bonuses in the primary currency of my programme, so that I can reward affiliates based on this currency","- It should be clear for the merchant in which currency are the criteria and the value of the bonus
- We need to make sure bonuses work for programmes of any currency (GBP, CAD, USD, EUR)",Anthony / Chris,3,Initial Scope,,8,Currencies
4,"As an affiliate, I want to be able to specify the currency of my transaction queries, so that the merchants can identify/check the transactions in their system and approve or decline my queries","- Current format should continue to work so that affiliates who created an automated process have no disruption
- Thereby, currency column should be optional and when no currency is specified use the primary currency of the programme
- When the currency reported by the affiliate is different from the primary currency of the programme then convert in the primary currency of the programme using the latest XE exchange rate available. 
- It should work for manual or automatic upload
- Affiliates guide for transaction query should be updated according to the new solution

5,"As a merchant, I want to have all necessary information on the transaction queries so that I can approve them with efficiency","- merchants should view the queries in the currency of their programme, but they should know when a transaction was passed in another currency and it should be possible to view the original value with the exchange rate that was used
- all current features to approving the queries should continue working normally
